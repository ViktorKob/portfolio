# Portfolio
This repository contains examples of how I prioritize tasks and solve problems. It is meant as a way to show potential employers what they can expect from me, as a developer.
For anyone not trying to employ me, this is just an example of how I would build a micro-service based platform, for looking up information in an environment centered around HBASE, using spring boot for implementation.
